Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic dataset
# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Shirleen Simon

This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The objective was to uncover hidden patterns, identify factors affecting passenger survival, and prepare the dataset for future modeling.

## 📌 Key Lessons Learned

- Developed a deeper understanding of EDA techniques using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Learned how to identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Explored univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships in the dataset.
- Discovered the significance of features like gender, passenger class, and family size on survival outcomes.
- Improved documentation and presentation of insights through visualizations and markdown annotations.

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked` columns  
- Univariate analysis (distribution of age, fare, survival rate)  
- Bivariate analysis (survival rate by sex, class, age group, etc.)  
- Multivariate analysis and correlation heatmaps  
- Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- Feature engineering (e.g., creating age groups)

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values can significantly affect analysis outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Charts like bar plots and heatmaps reveal relationships not obvious in raw data.
- **Feature Importance**: Gender and passenger class were strong indicators of survival.
- **Practical EDA Workflow**: Learned to approach data analysis systematically — from loading data to drawing insights.
